# SFNF-Tool
A command line tool for supporting binary chart data in FNF engines. Can be adapted for use in any Engine. 
Binary is much faster for parsing saved data into objects at runtime.

Use this command line tool to convert your json files to a custom  binary format. 

**Only supported on Windows OS for @SomeGuyWhoLovesCodes in progress Zenith Engine for now.**
